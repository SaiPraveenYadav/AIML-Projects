# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Projects

# 1. Applied Statistics
This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.

# Skills :
Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualisation, Statistical Inferences.

# 2. Supervised Learning
This Project involved using classification algorithms to predict the income level of the customers based on attributes like 'sex', 'marital-status', 'age', 'occupation' etc. The classification algorithms that were used are:

Logistic, K-NN and Naïve Bayes And finally, a comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction.

# Skills :
Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Algorithms.

# 3. Ensemble Techniques
Goal is to classify the patients into the respective labels using the attributes from their voice recordings.

# Skills :
Exploratory Data Analysis, Supervised Learning & Ensemble Learning.

# 4. Unsupervised Learning
The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

# Skills :
Exploratory Data Analysis,Exploratory Data Analysis , Reduce number dimensions in the dataset with minimal information loss & Train a model using Principle Components.

# 5. Featurization and Model
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

# Skills :
Exploratory Data Analysis, Building ML models for regression & Hyper parameter tuning.

# 6. Recommendation Systems
To make a recommendation system that recommends at least five(5) new products based on the user's habits.

# Skills :
Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling ,Build a Popularity recommender model & Build Collaborative Filtering model.

# 7. Computer Vision1

(I) The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species, University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of
determining a plant's species from a photo.

# Skills :
 Supervised learning,Neural networks & CNN algorithms.

(II) Brand research company wants to understand which cars or car manufacturers are popular in acertain area of the city or locality, build the image dataset to be used by the AI team to build an image classifier data. Import and display the images in python against their labels.

(III) The dataset comprises of images from 17 plant species. It can be downloaded from TensorFlow, Company’s management requires an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a flower’s species from a photo & Create a GUI to import the image “Prediction.jpg” and use the above designed AIML image classification model to predict the class/label of this image.
# [ Hint: import tflearn.datasets.oxflower17 as oxflower17 ]

# Skills :
 NN model,CNN transferred learning models & Tkinter for GUI

# 8. Computer Vision2

(I) The dataset comprises of images and its mask where there is a human face,detect Face on Images.

# Skills :
U-net along with pre-trained transfer learning models

(II) You are expected to curate the bounding box co-ordinates for each image, This task can be easily done using an automation where you need to input the image in the automation and the output is the coordinates of the face detected from the image.

# Skills :
This will require your analytical, research and development skills to try and design the automation required.

(III) Face Aligned Face Dataset from Pinterest. This dataset contains 10,770 images for 100 people. All images are taken from 'Pinterest' and aligned using dlib library.

# Skills :
PCA for dimensionality reduction & SVM classifier to map each image to its right person.

# 8. Natural Language Processing 1

(I) The need is to build a NLP classifier which can use input text parameters to determine the label/s of the blog.
